On this lecture we discussed the creative tripod that is comprised of three requirements of creativity and three parties that can have these properties: appreciation, skill, imagination; programmer, computer, consumer.
In my initial definition of creativity, by purposefulness I meant somewhat similar properties that in the tripod are called appreciation. 
The tripod is more human-centric and narrower than my own definition. Evolution of species by natural selection does not comfortably qualify as creative by the standards of the tripod, but to me it seems the most self-evidently creative process, because it has created the most complex and meaningful products we know of.
