======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
Creativity of a group of people is something that can be measured in a qualitative way. While we can consider qualitative research, it must be a quantitative research and it must be very precise, in order to provide enough data. And the question is not only what will this be a better result but also of course what is the optimal outcome for our group.
We have to have enough evidence and make it very clear. 
We have to have enough evidence! I'm afraid that the "we need more data, or we need more money" argument is sometimes the wrong tactic in this field.
Creativity, especially by the group, is a very complex and multifaceted task. Therefore, it is crucial that we have a clear idea of where we should stand on the continuum of the three criteria. When making a choice between the three different systems of evaluation, it would be good for me if I could know with some clarity what is my ideal result and what is my best result. Because this is an essential ingredient for making decisions on what is really best for a creative community.
Thoughts after the lecture on 03.10.2019
While speaking on the third criterion of creativity, I mentioned that the most important thing to remember is the role of evaluation. For us, evaluation should always be something that is specific. It should not be vague. If it's vague, then it is meaningless. 
Our system could be defined as a creative community of creative individuals. We are not a system of individuals whose minds are controlled by our own brains. Because we have no mind, we can't be described as any sort of brain by anyone. We can also think in a non-conscious way, of course in a non-digital way, but it should be a thinking thinking. That means our thinking and the mental activity that arises can be described in different ways and ways not necessarily related to our minds.
We are looking for a balance between the two criteria that is still too complex to discuss in technical details. In truth, we could have two criteria. For example, the question is not how many of our creative minds are in one group, but instead we may have two different communities; one of the groups, composed of many smart individuals, can make a good result that would benefit the rest of our community. At the same time, the criteria might be not so broad in terms of the groups of individuals that we are looking for. For instance, in our case the criteria should have some criteria that are shared by a

Creativity can also be evaluated via evaluation of their overall output. We can ask the following questions: Did the person create something new that had not been previously done? Did they discover a previously unknown new element in which they were not familiar? 
The question should be non-contradictory, and all these questions should be objective but not too vague, and we should ask questions about the person and the project, because this is a big part of how we evaluate creativity. I think the question of whether the person is a good artist or a good programmer seems to be a good one to ask the question that we can't answer in enough detail by asking the question of whether they created something new.
Ritchie describes a model of creativity, called the SPECS model, which is based on six main properties that people have in common, namely, appreciation, skill, imagination, creative process, and product output. 
I found there were three categories of criteria for creativity that were often conflated into "creativity of the human mind" by the MODERATES. While creativity can be the creative output of the human mind, to me it is a different process that is the result of a human-centered process.
These three categories that Ritchie proposes for creativity are: creativity of the mind, creativity of computer, and creativity of consumer.  But I will use a more specific definition for creative process:
Creativity of the mind is about the process of human thinking about things, but the process is not done exclusively by the person that thinks something. 
So, for me to have been creative, I had to think about the human who did it. Creativity of the mind is a function of how we interpret the process of the thinking person. 
Ritchie proposes that while creating and improving the product is one of the criteria for creativity, it is not the only criterion. He also notes that for creativity to be a criterion it need not have the quality of the creation of something new. 
I think if we are talking about the definition of creativity I think we would be more fruitful looking at the criteria to evaluate creativity of the mind. How is each of these criteria related to the process of our thinking? 
For me, it makes sense to think creatively to the extent to which we use our mind creatively to think about creative stuff. 
Creativity depends on imagination. It depends on our ability in imagination to come up with creative solutions to problem. It depends on our ability in imagination to see

======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
At the end of the lecture we had a discussion, which may seem to be trivial, but it made me remember that creativity is a creative process. We had to work on that. So when I have the time for this blog, I will post a comment with the thoughts before the lecture. But I did not finish and will have to write a follow up blog, that will be posted in the next few hours.
This is the first day of a project I am working on and it is the first of several projects that might look at this topic. However, it is a work in progress and I think it might be useful to include the comments since they would give a stronger message.
Here we discussed creativity of the SPECS model. Here are some of them.
Here are 3 of these thoughts.

I think that the first is pretty clear.  To me, the most relevant criterion is the ability to explain or understand. It seems that most human capabilities have this potential. (I would not call intelligence an independent criterion but I have observed that when people who perform intelligence tests think about creativity, a lot of times these abilities are used in the answer)
Also, the ability to communicate, not just to express an idea, should be considered. It could be hard with many types of people for some of the reasons mentioned. But for those who possess the ability, the ability to communicate is the main criterion, so it would be worth exploring.
The third thought is that creativity seems different in different things. Even on a computer one can be creative, but I think this can be done more often on a creative project. But for many things, one should try to understand, not to describe (though it does count). 
Here the idea to communicate and to interpret might count a bit too much (especially with a human being). I have a paper on that, but I will update when it is published. It shows us that for a computer there is a more universal criterion for creativity as indicated by SPECS.
Here is a list of what I believe to be our most unique, essential, key, and unique aspect of creativity.
1.  Inventive, creative thinking
2.  Inventive, creative work (the actual creativity), the actual work, no matter how small, it is meaningful and unique.
3.  Invention, creative work. Nothing needs to be invented, only to do it. There is a very obvious connection between creativity and invention, and so we
