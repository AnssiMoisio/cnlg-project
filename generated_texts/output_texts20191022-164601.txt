Once upon a time there lived an old man in the middle of a vast forest. There was no  people accompanying him but he had found friends in some of the woodland creatures. One day he was on a look for a certain kind of fungus with one of his eldest pals, a raven he had named Pitch after both her feather's color and the recognizable tone of her voice. Pitch had spotted a promising-looking opening with a lot mushrooms from her lofty point of view, and they were now heading towards it, the man calmly walking and Pitch flying from branch to branch above him.

The old sage spoke as he surveyed the forest for the coming storm. "Oh my, the forest seems very quiet tonight, will there be any wind that will carry us home, and perhaps bring down something as deadly as that dreaded fungus. Perhaps the forest should be called a 'place of quiet', and not an 'underworld'!"
"Oh, there will be no wind tonight," the old sage laughed as he watched the lightning bolt take shape. "I have told you a thousand times: if there is even a twig in the path of the lightning, this storm is coming your way! I say we take shelter, and I say we call my little band of woodsmen and we climb inside a cave in the nearest tree. I have no desire to talk with any of you until this storm is gone! We shall talk later, but the cave shall remain sealed until we can make it home!"
"Yes, my friends, let's go inside together," Pitch said in her soothing voice. 
She was the first to follow him out from the cave. There was nothing much to do as they walked towards the edge of the forest now but climb inside the cave and make their way to home as fast as they could. The cave was small, and the only things to stay safe inside were pitchfork and axes. She was a lot more experienced in climbing, and made faster progress as they were getting closer to home. Their pace slowed as they reached the bottom of the cave. 
"I've got the torch up here so we can see the cave with our pikes," the old sage said. "If we look at the wall around us, it looks like it's very easy for a huge spider to climb around. We'll just need a little patience."
"Do you mean that?" Pitch asked, but the old sage shook his head. "I don't have any time for patience. We must get down to the cave before there is even an opening!"
They came to a small opening in the wall and started to climb down, pitchfork at the ready. Once they had reached the end, they began to get a little worried. "There is a bit of a crevice or wall down there, no?" the old sage asked and turned to Pitch. "I mean, I could be wrong, but you look a bit anxious." She went ahead to poke around in the cracks with her pike and found the cave was actually quite small. The only tools we had were pitch
