Human-Computer Interaction will give human-computer interaction as a factor of creativity, and we can also test for the effects of human-computer interaction by asking questions from people.
And that is the first test: to what degree human-computer interaction in the classroom generates creativity in students.
Since there were no questions relevant to the project, my second test is of course what we would naturally think: how can students learn what they learn, even if the teacher is only teaching their subject for a few years?<|endoftext|>The latest addition to the ZX Spectrum line, the ZX Spectrum Mini, was one of few machines that could carry a colour cartridge and could also play a ZX Spectrum game. Unfortunately it was one of only a few Mini devices to appear during its generation.

As a special edition to their Spectrum Mini line, a red cartridge was given out to all those who bought an original ZX Spectrum Mini. For those lucky enough to find one in good condition they will be able to play it on any modern computer if they have a ZX Cartridge Port on it.

To access this feature, go to the 'My ZX' section.<|endoftext|>It's amazing how hard to find an article about science in today's press. Here's one (PDF), for example.

It's a very short piece on why the new findings, by scientists Michael Ecker and John Womersley, of how climate change could be affecting tropical forests in Africa, are significant. In it, Womersley makes the point that if global warming leads to higher species extinction, then "many species might be extinct, and they will have done it to get a warmer climate and more favourable conditions for growing food." That's not entirely wrong, I think.

But the thing is that in my view, Wobsley and Ecker are wrong.

I disagree with an important point of what Womersley and Ecker write:

"It would therefore be unlikely that the effects of climate change in Africa are concentrated on a relatively small number of tree species."

First of all, that's a good point. The fact that Wobsley and Ecker are using the term "climate change" means "climate change in some corner of Africa." As the article itself notes, "there will be changes in rainfall patterns in many African countries, and it is possible that some of these changes will have an indirect effect on vegetation of the savanna zone." But that doesn't seem to be the

Creativity is most clearly defined by the person who makes the work (or the person who gets the credit), not by the process that generated the work. 
Creative output is made in a different way from physical output. For example: a painter's paint or a car's engine drive does not change the color of a piece of paper. Even if one does not know what this paper is going to be used for, one might be able to describe it in a way that is easy for others to discern if this was the original intention. However, with computer programming one will not get results or to the point at which the outcome looks like the original intention at that precise time. As a result one will not be able to describe a precise input in a few sentences. This has a much broader range and will thus have less impact on creative output.
The work will not be completed but it should be recognizable. For example: a piece of code or a system. This will lead to a greater connection in the reader's mind. I think the following questions are important for evaluating creativity and the creative output.
To see whether there is any potential of new use for a creative problem: Is it similar to previous issues in the past? Is it the solution of some problem from the past (a bug, problem on a system, a novel design) or would it be a unique solution? Which issues were the most interesting for the programmer? Which were the most interesting issues with which the user started to learn? These questions are designed to elicit in the reader in the least possible time the kind of problems that the programmer was solving in the programming process and, finally, to show which issues can be considered the most interesting when evaluating a product, project or problem. For me, this is a more holistic evaluation of creative output.

This is all going to happen, right?

I was wondering when I would actually get my hands on this game, and I'm happy to report that today seems to be pretty close to when all of this stuff is coming.

======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
In the workshop on 28.9.2019, I discussed with the audience the characteristics of creativity that can be considered by the system. I also used these criteria to think about the key characteristics of the S-curve. All of our participants were very willing to answer the questions: the only thing we were unable to ask them was 'What are you?'.
The S-curve is an interesting phenomenon because it is highly subjective. Each single participant has its own interpretation. I think it is important that our participants understand this feature.
Ritchieâ€™s final thoughts and suggestions
Ritchie used a four-point scale of creativity to describe the criteria for creation of an output system.
Creativity is defined by an output to an end result of which others would be willing to participate and would benefit substantially from. Creativity requires one to have a basic imagination, and to know that the source of inspiration is always within a particular context. It is a creative process, meaning that it is not merely a product of the author's will and a few elements and resources available within his or her life. Creativity takes place within the human mind.
Creativity is more complex that the output of a creative process, and the criteria is a more precise one. But the key element is imagination. Imagination is the essential element in creativity: if we cannot imagine and imagine why we do things, then we are not creative.
It is also important to realise that creativity will be assessed on a continuum from the simplest to the complicated. A single moment on the continuum can be very powerful. This is very evident during the first days of the creation of 'The Beast': the process of writing the first paragraphs, using a computer on a first day, took me less than six years.
All aspects of creativity should be considered during this research. However, I believe these aspects deserve further investigation. As far as I am aware nothing has been done in this area of education or research in computer programming. Even with the best efforts one can only produce a minimal starting point during the initial days of the process. In my opinion, this is a major issue, and it might well be difficult to tackle it. Therefore, I believe what has happened with our participants is a very good illustration of the potential challenges. If you are one of those individuals whose contribution to this research is significant to you, then I encourage you to share your story with us. Our team is actively developing our methodology and working towards the next stage.<|endoftext|>A man who

For my definition of creativity in the SPECS models, here is why I think we have a lot to learn from computer and software creativity: The computer, in its many different forms, is a great source of creativity both as individuals and in society. 

Thoughts after the lecture on 8.10.2020
The SPECS models for computer performance were created to have a very specific objective: To help computer scientists, engineers, and scientists to analyze their design and problem solving processes, not to provide a generic definition for "creatives" (see Wikipedia entry ). We want scientists to use the tools at their disposal and to study themselves and their creativity. 
In the last lecture I gave, I talked about the various creative properties and why creativity is valuable. By analyzing the individual differences I identified in the SPECS data for the people who participated the most (compared to the controls), I identified three elements that differentiate them from the other participants. The creative elements I identified for people were things like creativity in the context of design, the importance of creativity for new ideas, and different types of creativity. I then made a comparison: 1.2.3.4.5.6.3.4.6.3.5.6.4.6.3.4.6.3.3.4.6.3.4.6.3.5.6.3.4.5.6.4.5.6.3.4.5.6.3.4.5.6.3.4.5.6.3.4.5, I discovered that creativity in this context is mostly about learning, not creating. It can be used in learning a topic or as a means of learning, like the way children enjoy puzzles. It is the difference between the way children and children's activities are usually organized: one is a creative process, the other a learning process. Children learn by observing and taking in information. The person on the playground who sees the ball in front of that person and reacts with some kind of reaction is not necessarily a great thinker. However, when a child tries not to think about the ball and tries to just watch the people around him, then this is a unique type of creativity (when, however, the child sees the ball, the other kids try to guess by looking at the ball, there is no creative process here). This study confirmed this observation further, as participants were more likely to make the connection between the interaction and the creativity when

Thoughts after the lecture on 31.9.2019
I thought I had given enough information to a programmer who wants to work on the system but he is still looking for the "root cause" of his creative output. At first I would guess that it is the computer, he must be doing something wrong. 
The next part would be to make the computer more like a designer and to try to make it aware of the human. 
In fact, the designer is always the most creative person on the planet. The designer is the one who makes everything look like it has meaning, but it is the human who creates meaning and then it comes back to the designer.
I think we should not think of the human as a limiting factor to creative process or a source of creative problem solving. It doesn't work that way when you consider the human as a source of creative problem solving. If someone is able to create something, the more of it they create, the more of themselves, as the designer, is increased.
I should add that, in general, I don't always agree with Ritchie's criteria of creativity. I also think I need more research and understanding of the human creative processes.
Thoughts after the lecture on 5.10.2019
A friend of ours told me what had happened when his program "came up short".
He has no programming experience and had not written any code for a while. When he started, this program took only 15 seconds from beginning to end.
But when it was running and there was no input it took him 10 minutes to finish.
He did not see the failure or the bugs because he was busy with his real work. When he was finished, this program ran and gave him 25 minutes from beginning to end.
My friend was more disappointed, he did not believe that this "slow" program was actually slow. He was hoping the program would come up faster. 
I think most of us are like him. So much so, that the time we spend creating something should not be considered waste.
This is why I think the human is always creative. It is the one that makes everything look creative, but that is ultimately the design process of the designer that creates the final design outcome. As the designer, the human is the key factor that makes the whole creative whole. So, even if you are not a programmer or not familiar with the details of human creative process, there shouldn't be a problem with the idea "human creativity". 

======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
This is, in my opinion, one of the more valid criterion of creativity since in a very basic sense the person cannot be said to be intelligent or creative if they cannot answer one or more questions. 
The definition of creativity used in Ritchieâ€™s empirical criteria focuses on the output of a creative process. Thus for people who can learn a new language, the output can be called creativity.
To me the most abstract concept in creativity: the output of the creatÆâ€' process. So I think it to be of more importance that we can evaluate the output of a creative process.

Thoughts after the lecture on 31.1.2019
In the research project that I did, I focused on people who could learn a non-linear language and then a linear language at the same time in that they were asked to learn both languages simultaneously. I also included a non-linear language learner who learned a non-linear language, but the non-linear learner was learning all three language simultaneously, and also a learner that could perform both non-linear and linear processes at the same time with no prior training. 
I do not think there is much difference between the processes of learning a new language and learning a new process. 
Since the person has a particular form of information-processing that was trained for at least a few dozen years, the way they can learn a new non-linear process and a linear process may seem like two different processes, but they are not. 
To me there are three more dimensions in our evaluation of creativity:
1- output of the creative process: the output of the creative process itself, whether it be in the form of new knowledge, creative products or new skills
2- the output of specific cognitive processes: if these occur in relation to creative process outputs, they may give meaning to those output. 
To me, creativity implies that someone who is creative is capable of generating different outcomes from the same inputs. There is nothing mystical about this idea in my opinion, because every human has a different creativity, but in the SPECS model, it is one dimension of creativity that needs to be determined.
3- the relationship of the creative process to the relationship between the creative process and the other dimensions. That is, a creative process that is in general useful can be said to have a positive relationship to the other dimensions of creativity as long as that process generates outputs with a meaning distinct from the output that the process would generate otherwise.
