This also means that if we want to study the creativity and creative process in our own minds, we need a good, unbiased, scientific way to do this. What I found is that I found a way to study creativity in a scientific way and make it accessible to everyday people and researchers.
The main problem was to find the most accessible ways to collect data about an individual. 
Although not as simple as measuring and classifying the subjective states and behaviors of a person, such tools do offer useful tools for understanding creativity in the context of science. While the results of the SPECS method can be analyzed in many dimensions, I still think that the more concrete dimensions can provide a valuable insight and context for studying creativity in scientific and professional contexts. I do not think that the abstract dimension of creativity may be as useful for these purposes as the qualitative dimension.
My research project was to collect data on a group of children. I expected that the data could be useful for understanding the creative process of children, but the main goal was to gather data on children's creativity. I did not expect that the data could be used for research purposes on creativity or that it could be shared among researchers, since I considered them to be "too generic."
Before I present the data analysis, I want to explain my main research question. 
My main research question is how to determine the creativity and creativity process of children. This is very similar to the question that we were studying. I expect that there may have been different ways to answer the question. 
I have created the SPECS Model of creativity using data from hundreds of studies as examples of the kinds of data that we could use to answer the questions posed in the question. 
I will use the data to show how creativity is a process that consists of distinct, individual skills from the perspective of children. I will show how these skills overlap, because I believe that children and adults have different levels of creativity. I will show how children develop these skill sets over time. I'll show that the skill set of a child increases over the course of childhood. I will show how creativity is in turn an ongoing process, rather than fixed over time; i.e., the same child develops creativity at different ages at different times. I will explain how this is possible, and how to analyze and find the patterns of change in the creativity of children. I will also show that the data collected from a large group of children is useful for studying creativity in children in scientific and professional contexts, including psychology.

At the same time, they should not be too general so that the participant can become a slave to the results. In short, they should ask questions relevant to the user and be clear about their values. The question "What does this mean to me?" is crucial. This is why it can't be a generic question (it can be a question for a specific task, but not for every task) or a question for a specific user (the latter is just a distraction from the former). It has to be something about their values and capabilities as a creator.

Some questions might involve learning, some might involve testing, and some might involve creating product. If using a question, I might use the exact same word to mean the same thing again. In these cases, a new question should be created. For example, I can ask when to use the word "truly", "in the moment", and "always". I can also specify the exact definition of each word. In this case a new definition of "creative" would be created. In this way, it will allow the user to be more creative and more productive while also minimizing the risk of making them feel like an automaton.

I think a person should be a little creative or at least be able to think about making it a little bit more creative, yet not too creative. 

I think if we look at people's motivations and abilities, we can make them a little bit artistic in their ability to think about making some of their own products better. We can use words that they know and use with the same intention that they use those word with to make something they would like to own. This can be through marketing language, or through simple usage which can be repeated in different contexts. An artist can make a painting better than what we know that is on his wall right now. 

I think using positive words can be an effective tool for creating more creativity. A word that has been negatively used on a person before should be substituted and is likely to create more creative output. This is why I think an artist can make their art better than what we know that is on his wall right now. 

One of my core beliefs at this point is that I should not be "artificial", that is, I shouldn't be using words with a specific meaning, the purpose of words has always been one of communication, not to be used to convey a false meaning in some way.

I think that an artist should be creative
