I spent an hour last week taking notes while talking about computational creativity systems and listening to people's opinions about them. I wrote a bit when I heard what someone thought about this process. I will have a blog post about it shortly.

The process of SPECS does have its pros and cons, but as I was taking notes, I found that I was not convinced that creativity is something that can be evaluated by the usual evaluation frameworks for art and science. That being, we are now in the transition period between what we had been taught about artistic and computational creativity and the reality of this phenomena.

Creativity has become my career, so perhaps things are going to change in the next years.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this list of Creative Thinking Tools.

"I just want to get drunk in the end zone for some good ol' fashioned pong and then go back to my normal Sunday morning routine and start working out all over," said one friend of Smith, 26, who added that he was "lucky enough" to be "so damn fit" so that he could put on weight and have a chance to play with a new and improved set of legs in the offseason. "I mean, I'm just a little too big to be this old and slow and I've always loved throwing beer pong as a kid. This is all just my way of thanking my teammates and getting this last hurrah out of me." At press time, sources confirmed he was looking at himself in the mirror and exclaiming "Shit, just what I needed!"

After nearly a month under fire, Trump has spent more time around his White House than he did during the campaign or shortly after the inauguration.

But even with the Trump family vacation — with "alternative facts" on their mind — it has been an increasingly tumultuous week for Trump the businessman. First there was the news that Trump's first travel ban, which would not have caused a major legal fight, was not legally binding and was already being modified by the courts.

This is a really nice paper, very well written. In the process of explaining their approach it takes me some time to come down to earth and realize all the issues I had with it. For all its advantages, the SPECS approach doesn't help us as an evaluator. While I agree that we need to ask whether our system is creative, I'd like to think that a creative system needs to be able to explain how it does so.


Week 3:

We extend our case study of the musical improvisation produced by computational creativity systems to another field of artistic creation in this session: visual art.

Creative work and visual art are, in some ways, a reflection to the ways things work that happens to be in the world. In visual art, we can look at the relationship between visual art, computers and algorithms. Visual art depends on algorithms and computer designs to create and create the artwork. We can also look at computational art, which creates visual and algorithmic artworks for the computer to create and create. These computational works reflect how things work.

A major difference between the artistic disciplines of painting, music, and computer art is that artists understand the relationship between art and data as well. I think it's important to note that this isn't merely a philosophical observation of ours; we've actually found some empirical support for it in our experiments. This has shown that computational work in art improves the quality of artworks, which means it is more likely to succeed at being reproduced. The same applies to music and computer programs, which are designed to produce music which is more likely to be reproduced. This is a more important question in visual art, because computer artwork is designed to create a specific audience and target audience. This also has a significant influence on why visual art is more likely to survive and be reproduced. However, the artistic discipline of music is less relevant for artistic outcomes.


Thoughts after the lecture: 
Visual art has its own particular culture, much more specifically the visual community. This culture, though also critical of computer art, can be fairly positive. Visual art has its own particular culture, much more specifically the visual community. This culture, though also critical of computer art, can be fairly positive. Many people in the visual art community like having a computer in their home, rather than a computer at work for various reasons. I believe this is because visual art, compared to computer art, has a stronger emphasis on aesthetics in its work, whereas computer art tends to================================================================================
