======================================== Model text ========================================
Once upon a time there lived an old man in the middle of a vast forest. There was no  people accompanying him but he had found friends in some of the woodland creatures. One day he was on a look for a certain kind of fungus with one of his eldest pals, a raven he had named Pitch after both her feather's color and the recognizable tone of her voice. Pitch had spotted a promising-looking spot with a lot mushrooms from her lofty point of view, and they were now heading towards it, the man calmly walking and Pitch flying from branch to branch.
================================================================================

======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
�Then, as with all good stories, both went missing. The man was never heard from again. Now Pitch wants to be found again. Pitch believes he has made the right decision in coming out of the forest. He is not afraid to look himself. He can see the place, the trees and the animals. He is ready to brave all of it. His friends will not follow him blindly through the treetops and they have no weapons to protect his back. He is not the most physically powerful man and his skills are limited by his age, but his mental capabilities far surpass his body. He knows that he is not the best fighter in the woods, but he thinks himself the better person because of his bravery and his ability to look for places with mushrooms. It is up to him to find these mushrooms, which he has never seen before, without being hunted by creatures that have the power to kill him. The man is always alone and sometimes he even needs to be in a tree alone in order to gather the mushrooms. And like an ant, he will only stay by the tree to avoid being captured. He is sure that at the very least he will never be captured by any sort of creature that is able to shoot them or put them out of their way without getting them killed. All he wants is the mushrooms and he is ready to get them. That is what you tell me, you old man in the forest?

The story of a boy who finds his home in the woods. My first book. This one has been on my Kindle for awhile!<|endoftext|>A man who was born without hands has successfully healed himself. On January 31st, a French physician told French television a 29-year-old man with only one hand was cured from the crippling disease. The story has been all over the world. I thought of a quote by Leonardo Da Vinci from a treatise, The Last Supper in 15th century Venice:

"I have cured the blind through the aid of art and science."

Dr. Richard Smith and Dr. Rene L�mmery both of the Hospital for Sick Children in Ottawa, Canada, have been working on the man's case on several fronts: He is back to walking; he now talks, but only occasionally; and his muscles are healed.

"This is the first time that my hands are working again," says Daniel, now 25, referring to an experimental procedure

======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
�Then a few minutes later it dawned on his friend, "You'll never see any more things like that." So when he saw the mushroom growing from a stalk with no leaves around it he went "Whoa! Whoa!" and put in the call to the "wild."
The next day Pitch had his friends go out with him.� When they got to the mushroom, they put a bit of the fungus on and then the two of them took off for the most wonderful place this side of heaven. There on their head, perched from the thicket, had emerged a beautiful creature with a crown over its head and a wide grin.
He had long ears and he waved to them as they came along, and then when it was time for them to get back on dry ground he got really excited and jumped from branch to branch.�
That is the way they landed, with Pitch leaping to the top of a tree and the monster hopping happily up to the top of the top of a tree and back to the ground once more, like it always does...
�The two of them then went away for a while, then the giant mushroom took a couple of more steps back and then the mushroom and the two friends went back to where they had come from, on their way up to their head. They all went back.
But all this time the mushroom had been growing from the soil until finally it was grown into this monster that stands behind the man, and the three of them are all together, watching the mushroom, while the old man is going back home to get the crown.
This is pretty much how it is, though, and it is also known as "the mushroom man". In the end a "Pitch" was able to get a "Pitch" that lived on the side of a mountain, which is another story.
To me, if this story really does happen like the "Pitch" description says, that it was actually a story-line I like. In all the time since the old mushroom came back, I have not heard that the people who lived there called him "Pitch." They might call him "Pitch" now though. The old man might call him "Pitch" even though we have established that it was a huge, giant mushroom on a tree. When you are talking about a giant Mushroom that is growing for a long time in a place the people there call "Pitch," that is a rather nice distinction.<|endoftext|>Mortar and I

======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================

Pitch was now almost halfway down the hill, and the man could see that she was starting to turn into the mushrooms that the two of them were looking for. At this point the older man saw that she was now in a position at which he could see the tops of the trees he was climbing over. Pitch was now approaching closer, so the old man reached over and started grabbing on to her hair. "I need you to hold on to me" he yelled, "or I'll throw you off of me." Pitch continued to move forward, but still had the old man's hand on her hair. As he started pulling it ever closer, he made a snap decision and started throwing Pitch forward again. "Stop" he yelled, "I'm trying to grow my hat of mushrooms." The man didn't care and kept pitching her forward, which just made her slide towards him. Her hands started to be able to reach the edge of the tree and she finally reached them again, this time she pushed up past him. She landed with a thud on the dirt, and the man jumped up and picked her up immediately. "Now hold on" the old man told his friends "It will help us." Pitch did so and the old man took his time to pick her up. He then held her up to him and started to speak, which they could then listen to as he explained why he was holding her up, telling her that she was the first person that he had ever talked to, and that she did things he couldn't think of. He also told her of how the mushroom he was after could be poisonous and that the mushrooms inside of it were poisonous. He told her that she could either stay in the tree or go back to the forest or to the cave he had been in. Pitch finally understood this and with that she slowly rose up off the ground and onto his back. "This one's a challenge"
The old man let her go and made her leave, knowing that the two of them would have to wait in the shade of the tree for another thirty minutes or so. After that first day, the two of them continued to play in the tree together, singing and dancing around it together. After several days of this, the old man realized that the one of the trees that they had been playing at had dried out, and he started to think that maybe the two of them were not going to be able to find enough mushrooms to make a hat out of them all. So, to make him feel

======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================

One day another friend of his came by and discovered an open space with some mushrooms of the kind, these too were very tasty and the man was determined to sample them while they were still good quality. He gathered them all and brought them home, the food of such a large gathering is likely to be eaten. The man ate them in a moment of weakness and it left a strong feeling in his stomach. The next day they found a cave but no place to call their own. There was only room for themselves, so they gathered a nearby rock and erected a platform to set up their tent. The first and only creature they met was a rabbit they named Haze, they gave her some shelter as they dug a little hole in the ground in the center of the platform and built themselves a nest. It was a pretty small one though, so they covered it up after a short while and added some other things inside including a bed, food and the best thing of all the room: a fire. 
Then, on another day, they were off on their first and final expedition, but this time they didn't have any luck. While scouting for new routes, Haze stumbled into a small swamp. The two of them spent the rest of the day there and, on one level, the swamp was a really nice place to spend an afternoon, a beautiful spring ran underneath the ground and the breeze was wonderful; but it became clear after a while that the swamp wasn't enough to sustain a group of eight. So, with the help of the raven, Pitch and the rest of the party, they made for the next swamp but it was so damn hot. This time they also went by another route they've heard of: the one down the other side. After a few hours spent digging through it, they found nothing there but mud the size of their arm, only a few things grew in the swamp at all but nothing. They decided to wait for the next day and see if their luck would change, if only for some reason. On their way back to this point, they found themselves almost being caught on a rock by another tribe of monkeys, after waiting and watching them take turns with the monkey the two of them, Pitch and Haze, were in a huge fight. It was so bad it was nearly impossible to fight the other guys, they had to break their rope and tie it on a tree where the other three took shelter from the heat. After a few tries, the monkey finally broke their rope and Pitch jumped down and

======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================


Then he saw a huge blue butterfly with a glowing eye at its end; this was the butterfly the old man had been looking for the whole time, and he found it too. A bright and happy moment ensued for the man, and after a little while he started to fly after Pitch.

As he was climbing, he noticed that Pitch had a tiny bit of trouble with a big spider. She tried to fly out of the way, but she was too nervous. The old man was able to guide her by using the orb's light, and as they started flying he said to himself: "What a beautiful sight, and I have one more thing to tell you."

A little while later he said to his friend, "Pitch, I don't have to tell you what just happened, but you need to put away your fly and don't let it hurt you!"

Pitch looked at him and nodded vigorously, the bird flapping its wings, looking for another way to get out.

As the old man flew towards the spot where the fungus was, the butterfly was still too scared of the spider to fly. When the old man realized that it was only a few centimeters away, he quickly pulled the orb from his pocket. He looked at the orb and asked Pitch, "If you don't fly now, you might lose yourself in the forest. We have no need to lose ourselves here. Run and get the fungi to our tree here and give me a nice call right now."

Pitch flew back towards her friends and began her final run, and, even though she was nervous, she was fast. She flew into the direction of the mushroom's head, and soon after she came out right where the orb was. The orb light was still lit, and as the orb was moving towards the spot where the light was, he saw Pitch's body fly out of it, but before it would leave the orb she saw a huge butterfly fly out of there. She was very glad he told her that she had run too fast for her to find, and she didn't have the courage to fly that fast on her own.

Then Pitch ran towards the location where she wanted to fly, but the spider just ran into the forest, and that's where she met her end.<|endoftext|>For over ten years, the only thing to do in Tanglewood was get down on one knee, place one toe in the ground, and walk for a long time. But that's all

======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================

They had seen the small patch a mile up a large ridge from the main trail and were on the main path. They had set up up camp and got the fire going and were just about to eat when the old man said something peculiar. "Pitch!" He said turning and pointing, and Pitch came out and landed in his lap "You found it, right?" he said proudly, as he looked up and peered down at the campite. "Yeah, what d'ya want for it?" he asked looking puzzled, like he never heard it said before, but it was pretty clearly his idea of what to do. "Come to my house tomorrow morning," he said and jumped up and hopped on his back. "Why? Come to my house and we'll get you one." Pitch looked at him suspiciously, but just nodded and followed with a smile on her face. He brought the campfire to life and started cooking breakfast before heading off to his place. The sun rose over the pine trees and the moon was shining off the green leaves. It looked like heaven, though it was not heaven at all. The man started to walk and climb a tree. "There's something good and bad in this world," he said to himself, and he was right. He made his way up the tree, he wasn't sure what exactly it was, but he got to a point. "We aren't going anywhere till we find it," he said to himself and reached a point at the sky with his arm down and his finger over it. He brought a single finger and pulled up the finger by the base like a cat. He then brought an empty hand and pressed down on it to draw it upwards, his finger drawing in that single palm on the ground. At that point, he felt a very distinct breeze blowing. "This is it!" he said to himself, as the breeze blew up and over his shoulder, and his fingers grew bigger and longer. "This is the sign of a true friend!" he thought to himself. He took a breath and looked to the sky and was blown away by this massive, giant, giant bird wing! He was blown away so deep and so strong it could break his neck. That's all I got, it could go anywhere and kill my mother! Suddenly his head was covered with feathers and started to fly up. He was blown up far higher than he came, and it was still blowing. "This is the sign of the dragon bird, it can soar from earth to
