In this lecture I learned many things. I think that the model is fairly complicated as such and that there are seven things that I would do differently. Firstly, I think my thoughts are what I think. Secondly, in my opinion there are three flaws in this. My thinking is the best thinking. My own opinion and my thoughts are in conflict with all other opinions. I think I would say that I am not aligned with this model. The lecture was interesting and I learned models and things. I learned new thoughts and I learned that computers are creative. This is what I have to say about the theory discussed in this lecture.
