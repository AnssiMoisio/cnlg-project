Once upon a time there lived an old man in the middle of a vast forest. There was no  people accompanying him but he had found friends in some of the woodland creatures. One day he was on a look for a certain kind of fungus with one of his eldest pals, a raven he had named Pitch after both her feather's color and the recognizable tone of her voice. Pitch had spotted a promising-looking opening with a lot mushrooms from her lofty point of view, and they were now heading towards it, the man calmly walking and Pitch flying from branch to branch above him.
